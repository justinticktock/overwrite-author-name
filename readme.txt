Overwrite Author on save to a consistent name.

== Description ==

Overwrite Author Name is a plugin to ensure on save of a post a user name will be replaced. This allows the site to have a consistent authorship and protects from individual users from leaving their name as author.  This is important as users can then login with their own username/password using capabilities allocated, however, content will have a corporate author name.
